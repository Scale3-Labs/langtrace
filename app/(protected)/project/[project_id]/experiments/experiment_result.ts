            "There are several steps you can take to prevent SQL Injection attacks:\n\n1. Use parameterized queries: Use parameterized queries instead of directly embedding user input into SQL statements. This helps to separate data from code and prevents attackers from manipulating the query structure.\n\n2. Input validation: Validate all user input before using it in SQL queries. Make sure that the input matches the expected format and type.\n\n3. Escape user input: If you must dynamically generate SQL queries using user input, make sure to escape special characters in the input to prevent SQL injection.\n\n4.

Sanitize user inputs: One of the most common ways attackers exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities is through user inputs. Make sure to validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent malicious code from being executed.\n\n3.

Avoid using an admin account for regular application tasks.\n\n5. Update and patch regularly: Make sure your database management system, web server, and application software are up to date with the latest security patches to protect against known vulnerabilities.\n\n6.

This can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to data or manipulate it in unintended ways.\n\n2. Sanitize user inputs: By validating and sanitizing all user inputs, you can ensure that no malicious SQL code is included.

Use parameterized queries: Parameterized queries separate SQL code from user input, treating them as data rather than executable code. This prevents attackers from injecting SQL statements through user inputs.\n\n4. Limit database permissions: Implement a principle of least privilege by granting only necessary permissions to database users. Avoid using overly permissive admin accounts for everyday tasks, reducing the potential impact of a successful attack.\n\n5.
