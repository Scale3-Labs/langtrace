Langtrace is an open source observability software which lets you capture, debug and analyze traces and metrics from all your applications that leverages LLM APIs, Vector Databases and LLM based Frameworks.

![image](https://github.com/Scale3-Labs/langtrace/assets/105607645/6825158c-39bb-4270-b1f9-446c36c066ee)

## ✨ Features

- 📊 **Open Telemetry Support**: Built on OTEL standards for comprehensive tracing
- 🔄 **Real-time Monitoring**: Track LLM API calls, vector operations, and framework usage
- 🎯 **Performance Insights**: Analyze latency, costs, and usage patterns
- 🔍 **Debug Tools**: Trace and debug your LLM application workflows
- 📈 **Analytics**: Get detailed metrics and visualizations
- 🏠 **Self-hosting Option**: Deploy on your own infrastructure

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# For TypeScript/JavaScript
npm i @langtrase/typescript-sdk

# For Python
pip install langtrace-python-sdk
```

Initialize in your code:
```typescript
// TypeScript
import * as Langtrace from '@langtrase/typescript-sdk'
Langtrace.init({ api_key: '<your_api_key>' }) // Get your API key at langtrace.ai
```
```python
# Python
from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace
langtrace.init(api_key='<your_api_key>') # Get your API key at langtrace.ai
```

For detailed setup instructions, see [Getting Started](#-getting-started).

## 📊 Open Telemetry Support

The traces generated by Langtrace adhere to [Open Telemetry Standards(OTEL)](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/). We are developing [semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/semantic-conventions/) for the traces generated by this project. You can checkout the current definitions in [this repository](https://github.com/Scale3-Labs/langtrace-trace-attributes/tree/main/schemas). Note: This is an ongoing development and we encourage you to get involved and welcome your feedback.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Langtrace Cloud ☁️

To use the managed SaaS version of Langtrace, follow the steps below:

1. Sign up by going to [this link](https://langtrace.ai).
2. Create a new Project after signing up. Projects are containers for storing traces and metrics generated by your application. If you have only one application, creating 1 project will do.
3. Generate an API key by going inside the project.
4. In your application, install the Langtrace SDK and initialize it with the API key you generated in the step 3.
5. The code for installing and setting up the SDK is shown below:

###  If your application is built using typescript/javascript

```typescript
npm i @langtrase/typescript-sdk
```

```typescript
import * as Langtrace from '@langtrase/typescript-sdk' // Must precede any llm module imports
Langtrace.init({ api_key: <your_api_key> })
```

OR

```typescript
import * as Langtrace from "@langtrase/typescript-sdk"; // Must precede any llm module imports
LangTrace.init(); // LANGTRACE_API_KEY as an ENVIRONMENT variable
```

### If your application is built using python

```python
pip install langtrace-python-sdk
```

```python
from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace
langtrace.init(api_key=<your_api_key>)
```

OR

```python
from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace
langtrace.init() # LANGTRACE_API_KEY as an ENVIRONMENT variable
```

### 🏠 Langtrace self hosted

To run the Langtrace locally, you have to run three services:

- Next.js app
- Postgres database
- Clickhouse database

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Checkout our [documentation](https://docs.langtrace.ai/hosting/overview) for various deployment options and configurations.

Requirements:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

#### The .env file

Feel free to modify the `.env` file to suit your needs.

#### Starting the servers

```bash
docker compose up
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Take down the setup

To delete containers and volumes

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

`-v` flag is used to delete volumes

## Telemetry

Langtrace collects basic, non-sensitive usage data from self-hosted instances by default, which is sent to a central server (via PostHog).

The following telemetry data is collected by us:
- Project name and type
- Team name

This data helps us to:

- Understand how the platform is being used to improve key features.
- Monitor overall usage for internal analysis and reporting.

No sensitive information is gathered, and the data is not shared with third parties.

If you prefer to disable telemetry, you can do so by setting TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false in your configuration.
